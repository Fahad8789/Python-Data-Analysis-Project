# Python-Data-Analysis-Project (Uber data)
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of Uber ride data using Python to uncover key insights about customer booking behavior. The main goals were to answer critical business questions related to ride categories, purposes, timing, and distances. Specifically, I:

Identified which category of Uber rides was booked the most.

Analyzed the main purposes for which people booked Uber rides.

Determined the time of day when most Uber rides were booked.

Investigated the months when Uber rides were booked less and most frequentlyl.
